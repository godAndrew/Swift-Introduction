//In swift comments are like this
/* 
And like this
*/
// Print command is just like python, no big deal

print("Hello Swift")

// To declare a variable we must use let or var followed by the name of the variable, : , and the type

let constant: Int = 10
var variable: Double = 10.10
constant = 20 // Error!, we only use let on values that aren't going to change in our code
variable = 10.10 + 20 // Well done!, we can chance the value of variable because it was declared with var instead let

Usually parameters go inside () and Instructions go inside {}
To create a function we use the reservated word func

Sintax Tips:
[] means Array, and [Int] means array of integers
-> this arrow is used to specify the type of the value that our function will return
1...20 means 1 to 20 including both 1 and 20
1>.. means 1 to 20 excluding 1
1..<20 means 1 to 20 excluding 20
1>.< means 2 to 19


Exemple: create a function that receives an integer number and return a list of all even numbers between 1 and the number

func even_Integers (parameter: Int) -> [Int] { // realize that the function receives and integer and return an array of integers
           var evenList = [Int]() //Another way to declare, [Int]() means an empty array that receives integer numbers                                
           for i in range 1...parameter{
                      if i % 2 != 0{
                            evenList.append(i)
                      }         
           }
           return evenList
}
// Calling the function

even_Integers(parameter: 10)
output: [1,3,5,7,9]


This example show us a little about how swift sintax works, i'll post some exercises for you to see my progress and learn with me!
Let's code together, and if i said something wrong sorry for my english!
